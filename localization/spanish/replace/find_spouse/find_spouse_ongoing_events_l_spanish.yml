find_spouse_ongoing.1001.desc:0 "#EMP As I contemplate the prospect of finding a spouse to solidify my reign and secure the future of my dynasty, the weight of the decision becomes evident. A capable herald who could weave diplomacy like a master could prove instrumental in navigating the intricate webs of courtly life, seeking candidates for strategic alliances, power and prestige.\nOn the other hand, if I choose a friend, I'm sure they will base their choices on or near his realm and might prioritize love, companionship or even family ties over political gains.\nAnd a learned and cultured herald, with their insight, although with more limited reach, may strive to find a healthy spouse capable of bearing strong heirs.\nHumm...As for my spymaster's counsel, yet more detailed, I can expect a myriad of intriguing choices, for they revel in the realm of uncertainty and secrets.\nAlternatively, I could take the role upon myself, hoping a personal touch might foster genuine connections with potential candidates or, ultimately, leave it all in destiny's hands.\n\nThe fate of my realm rests on this pivotal choice, and I must tread carefully to ensure a prosperous future.#EMP"
